A ruby gem to interact with the Snapfulfil API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'snap-api', require: 'snap'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

```ruby

Snap.configure do |config|
  config.endpoint = 'https://your-api-endpoint'
  config.username = 'Fred'
  config.password = 'Rogers'
end

```

## Usage

```ruby

Snap::Api::Shipments.find(id: 'your-shipment-id')

```



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Tests

Once you've setup your environment you can run the tests with `rake spec`. In
order to re-record VCR cassettes you'll want to make sure you have the following
env var set as follows: `VCR=all`.
